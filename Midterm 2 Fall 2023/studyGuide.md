### Summary of Lecture 15: Function Pointers and Abstraction in C

- **Abstraction in Languages**: 
  - Encapsulated in structures for information hiding, e.g., classes in Java.
  - Refactor common usage patterns, like a sorting routine for different types.
  - C lacks Java-like data abstractions but offers functions as a refactoring mechanism.

- **Types and Computation**: 
  - Functions abstract computations over various types, such as basic and structured types.
  - Functions themselves are a form of abstraction, representing a set of computations.

- **Function Pointers in C**: 
  - Treated like any other data object: can be argument, returned, stored, or compared.
  - Main limitation: cannot assign to a function pointer as it resides in read-only memory.

- **Creating Lists with Function Pointers**: 
  - Example shown with different ways to populate a list using function pointers.
  - `makeGenList` function creates lists with elements determined by specific operators.

- **Deriving a Recipe for Generic Computation**: 
  - `fold` function example: computes over list elements with an accumulator.
  - Functions like `sum`, `mul`, and `max` used to demonstrate the versatility of `fold`.

- **Map Functionality**: 
  - Applies a function to each element in a list.
  - Demonstrated with functions like `add`, `min`, and `eve`.

- **Objects in C**: 
  - Example of using function pointers for object-oriented solutions, such as drawing shapes.
  - Managing state in functions and objects, like implementing a counter function.

- **Notes on Function Abstraction**: 
  - Functions are primary abstractions in C, allowing for advanced refactoring.
  - Stored in memory differently, function pointers enable dynamic function invocation.
  - Function pointers partition computation between caller and callee.
  - Generic computations (like `fold`) can be expressed in terms of list elements and an accumulator.
  - Suggestion to rewrite `fold` with a while loop for efficiency.

### Summary of Lecture 16: Sorting and Generic Bubble Sort

- **Bubble Sort Basics**:
  - A simple sorting algorithm that swaps out-of-order elements in an array.
  - Inefficient but easy to understand and implement.
  - Iterates through the array, swapping elements until no more swaps are needed.

- **Bubble Sort Implementation**:
  - A function `bubble_sort_int` is created to sort integers using bubble sort.
  - Repeatedly goes through the array, swapping pairs of elements that are out of order.
  - Stops when no more swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.

- **Improving Bubble Sort**:
  - To make `bubble_sort_int` more generic, it is modified to accept a comparator function (`should_swap`).
  - The comparator function allows sorting in different orders, not just ascending.

- **Generic Bubble Sort Implementation**:
  - Modified to accept any type of data, not just integers.
  - The comparator and data are made generic using `void *`, and the function is given the size of the array and element size.
  - This allows swapping to be generic, making the whole sort function more versatile.

- **Function Pointers in Sorting**:
  - The comparator function (`should_swap`) is passed as a function pointer.
  - This approach allows for flexibility in defining the sorting criteria.

- **Example Comparators**:
  - `sort_ascending` and `sort_descending` functions are given as examples of comparator functions.

- **Generic Comparators and Bubble Sort**:
  - The comparator function's parameters are `void*` to handle any type of data.
  - The `bubble_sort` function is designed to work with any array type by accepting generic comparators.

- **Calling Generic Bubble Sort**:
  - The comparison function is passed pointers to the elements being compared.
  - The comparison function is responsible for handling the actual comparison logic, tailored to the specific data type.

### Summary of Lecture 17: Callbacks and Asynchronous Programming in C

- **Function Pointers as Callbacks**:
  - Serve multiple roles when used as function arguments.
  - Encapsulate computation provided by the caller.
  - Form a simple object-oriented abstraction.
  - Enable callee to conditionally update callerâ€™s state.

- **Callback Types**:
  - **Synchronous Callbacks**: Complete their computation before returning. Examples include comparator in bubble sort, and function pointers in `fold` or `map`.
  - **Asynchronous Callbacks**: Return to the caller before completing their computation, running tasks concurrently in the background. Examples include network I/O and packet filtering.

- **Context of Callbacks in C**:
  - C, primarily a sequential language, interfaces closely with operating system services which often execute concurrently.
  - Callbacks interact with services like devices, network controllers, and GUIs.

- **Asynchronous I/O Example**:
  - Traditional I/O operations are synchronous, returning only after completion.
  - Asynchronous I/O allows operations to return immediately while continuing work in the background.
  - Callbacks manage asynchronous I/O actions effectively.

- **DNS Lookup Example**:
  - Traditional DNS lookup (synchronous): Client requests an IP address, waits for the response.
  - Asynchronous DNS lookup using callbacks: Client registers callbacks for receiving and sending data, allowing for non-blocking operation.

- **Generalizing Callbacks**:
  - Limited interactions with the external environment in C.
  - Signal interface in C: signal name, handler associated with the signal, and a mechanism to raise the signal.

### Summary of Lecture 18: Signals in C - Synchronous vs Asynchronous Actions

- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous Actions**:
  - **Synchronous Action**: Similar to a procedure call, where the caller waits for the callee to return a result, e.g., a phone call.
  - **Asynchronous Action**: A response from the environment that does not require the caller to wait for a response, e.g., typing Ctrl+C during program execution.

- **Dealing with Asynchronous Actions**:
  - **Polling**: Asking the kernel or OS if a specific event has occurred since the last check.
  - **Handling**: Informing the OS to perform a specific action when an event occurs, using signals.

- **Kinds of Signals**:
  - **Interrupts**: Triggered by the environment, e.g., SIGINT (Ctrl-C).
  - **Hardware Signals**: Generated due to hardware exceptions, e.g., SIGSEGV for invalid memory references.
  - **Software Signals**: Arise from software events, e.g., SIGPIPE for a broken pipe.

- **Handling Signals**:
  - **Ignoring**: Not always possible, especially for hardware exceptions.
  - **Catching**: Setting up a signal handler to execute when a signal occurs.
  - **Default Actions**: Most signals, by default, terminate the process.

- **Generating Signals**:
  - `kill(pid_t pid, int sig)`: Sends a specified signal to a process.
  - `raise(sig)`: Generates a signal to be handled by the program that invoked the call.

- **Common Signals**:
  - SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGINT, SIGSEGV, SIGTERM, SIGUSR, etc., each with specific use cases.

- **Defining Signal Handlers**:
  - Handlers are defined using the `signal` function, which associates a signal with a handler function.

- **Examples of Signal Usage**:
  - Calculating factorials and handling errors using SIGUSR1.
  - Using signals and handlers to manage a clock structure and update it every second with SIGALRM.

- **Practical Considerations**:
  - Signal semantics and implementation can be complex and poorly defined.
  - Libraries like `sigaction.h` provide cleaner semantics and portability.
  - Handlers must be designed carefully to avoid faults.

### Answer Key

#### 1. Function Pointers: Basic Syntax
- `operation = add;`
- `operation = subtract;`

#### 2. Function Pointers: Abstraction
- E. Loop in map should use `<=` instead of `<`.

#### 3. Function Pointers: Comparators
- `compare_asc`

#### 4. Data Structures: Generic Implementation
- No additional blanks needed.

#### 5. Generics: Implementation Challenge
- D. Correct as is.

#### 6. Signal Handling: Basic
- No additional blanks needed.

#### 7. Undefined Behavior: Identification
- E. Using uninitialized variables.

#### 8. Optimizations: Techniques
- A. Loop unrolling.

#### 9. Strings, Arrays, Stack Management: Operations
- `*src`
- `*str2`
- `*str1 != *str2`
- `*str1`

#### 10. Linked-List: Operations
- D. Correct as is.

#### 11. Stack Implementation: Generic
- No additional blanks needed.

#### 12. Challenge Question: Combining Concepts
- Use of function pointers within the `apply` function is the key concept here, with no specific correct answer from the provided options, as it depends on the implementation details.
